# Housing-Price-EDA
In this analysis, we will look into how different factors affect the price of houses. We will compare how the distance from metro/subway stations affects the price vs how the distance to the nearest city affects it. We will also analyze how the age of the houses affects the price. 

This data comes from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rukenmissonnier/final-house
